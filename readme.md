## About
This is a combination light/dark color scheme because I like to have my Editor look different from the rest of the interface.
The Editor is a light theme, while the main tools are all a dark grey. The console is black. I made it extra dark because hyperlinks
were unreadable with a merely dark background. 

## Install

Download the .icls file and import it into your color schemes settings in Webstorm.
